Social Media API

## Description
This project uses Mongo DB, Mongoose, Node, and Express.js, to build a social media API.

### Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to create a social media API where users are able to share thoughts, add friends, and react to friend's thoughts. 

### Functionality:

Using several Express.js routes, users can add friends, post thoughts, and react to thoughts. The api has Create(post), Read(get), and Update(put) routes to allow for interactivity with the Mongo DB database.

### Goals Accomplished:

Users are able to add thoughts, friends and reactions via this social media API.

### Notes:

I refactored code from the week 18 mini-project to create a functional API
